## Instructions

## Getting started
#### To get started choose a grid size and color. Click the submit button and a grid with specified dimentions will be generated. They will be filled with the color you chose. If the clicked cell is already filled, then the color will be removed.

## Restarting
### To restart, click the submit button and the grid will be reset. You can select another grid size and color if you want.

## Picking a color
### Depending on your browser you might or might not see a color picker. If there is no color picker then put in the hex value of the color in full hex format, no abbreviated hex values will work.

## Contributing
### To contribute to this project, fork the repo and make your changes. Then submit a pull request on the repository and if necessary, it will be accepted.
